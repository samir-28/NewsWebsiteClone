            <h4>Pic: Cristano Ronaldo With His First Ever International Trophy (EURO 2016)</h4>
            <p>
                The final took place in front of 75,868 spectators and 
                was refereed by English official Mark Clattenburg. Midway through
                 the first half, Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo was taken off the pitch
                  on a stretcher injured and was replaced by Ricardo Quaresma, leaving
                   Nani playing alone upfront. The first half ended goalless and neither
                    side made any changes to their playing personnel during the interval.
                     Despite opportunities to score for both sides, regular time ended 0–0
                      and the match went into extra time. The game remained goalless, and three
                       minutes into the second period of additional time, Raphaël Guerreiro's free kick
                        from around 25 yards (23 m) struck the underside of the France crossbar. A minute 
                        later, Portugal took the lead through Eder: his low shot from 25 yards (23 m) beat
                        France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. After two minutes of stoppage time, the final whistle
                         was blown and Portugal won the match 1–0, to claim their first major tournament title.
