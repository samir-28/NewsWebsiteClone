            <h3>Demand for IVF, IUI services in Nepal rises manifold</h3>
            <p id="one">Doctors at the Paropakar Hospital say around 160 people are on the waiting list to receive either eggs or sperm.</p>
            <img src="./images/OIP.jpg" alt="IVF image" height="300px" width="200px" id="ivf">
            <p id="one"> Published at : December 19, 2023</p>
            <p id="two">Of late, around 50 to 60 women seeking treatment for infertility problems visit the outpatient department of Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital every day.

                The number used to be 10 to 15 until a few years ago, according to doctors at the hospital.
                
                The number of women seeking intrauterine insemination (IUI), an artificial insemination in which doctors insert semen directly inside the uterus, and in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), a fertility treatment where eggs are combined with sperm, has also risen significantly.
                
                “Demand for infertility treatment in our hospital suggests the scale of the problem in society,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, director at the hospital. “We have been providing IUI service to three women every day and IVF to three women each week.”
                
                Hospital administration said that around 80 women and a similar number of couples are on the waiting list to receive eggs or sperm to have babies. Officials at the hospital said that they are yet to start eggs and sperm donation services due to a confusion in the law. They said that the hospital has been consulting legal experts to start egg and sperm donation.
                
                The health institution charges Rs6,000 for IUI service, under which doctors open blocked fallopian tubes, give medicines for producing eggs and insert specially prepared sperm directly into the uterus.</p>

          <h3>State Affairs Committee directs against approval of Ncell deal</h3>

          <p id="two">
            The State Affairs and Good Governance Committee on Tuesday directed against approving the sale of Ncell.

The parliamentary committee directed the government to halt the Malaysian company Axiata’s efforts to sell its shares in the Nepal-based mobile service provider until a detailed investigation into the matter is completed.

The decision was taken following the committee’s meeting with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, and Minister of Communication and Information Technology and government spokesperson Rekha Sharma.

The letter issued by the committee directs “…the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers, Finance Ministry, Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supply not to approve or consent to the buyout of Ncell until the final report of the investigative committee has been completed.”

The committee has also directed the government to take into account the findings of the ‘share purchase and sale investigation committee 2080’ and recover all due amounts, including taxes, applicable as per law.

Similarly, the committee has instructed evaluation of the buyer’s ability and experience during the sale of large companies like Ncell.

The government had formed a five-member high-level committee to investigate the buyout of Ncell on December 7. A Cabinet meeting constituted the panel under former auditor general Tanka Mani Sharma. It has been given 30 days to study the matter and submit its report.

On December 1, Axiata announced that it had entered into an unconditional sale and purchase agreement (SPA) with Spectrlite UK Limited to sell Reynolds Holding Limited, which owns approximately 80 percent equity stake in the Nepal-based Ncell Axiata Limited.

Spectrlite UK, registered in the United Kingdom in September this year, is owned by Satish Lal Acharya, a person of Nepali origin currently based in Singapore. Sunivera Capital Venture, owned by his wife Bhavana Singh Shrestha, has another 20 percent stake in Ncell.

            <h3>Nepal’s nod to Dhaka’s proposal on trilateral energy cooperation</h3>
            <p id="one">Nepal, Bangladesh and India often discuss power trade, but they don’t have a mechanism to remove bottlenecks.</p>
            <img src="./images/thumb (1).jpg" alt="IVF image" height="300px" width="200px" id="ivf">
            <p id="one"> Published at : December 15, 2023</p>
            <p id="two">Nepal has agreed to Bangladesh’s proposal on establishing a joint trilateral mechanism at the highest bureaucratic levels among three countries, including India, to promote energy cooperation.

                Nepal had received the Bangladeshi proposal in late November as three countries expressed their eagerness to promote cooperation in energy, particularly when it comes to widening the clean energy market in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) sub-region of South Asia.
                
                “We have sent our comments to the Bangladeshi side on its proposal,” said Nabin Raj Singh, spokesman at the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation. “We have agreed to almost all points of the proposal since it has cleared up most issues over the joint trilateral mechanism.”
                
                As per the Bangladesh’s proposal, a trilateral Joint Working Group (JWG) and a Joint Steering Committee (JSC) headed by joint secretaries and secretaries of relevant ministries respectively will be established to promote cooperation in the power sector.
                
                “The joint mechanism will promote energy cooperation among the three nations by removing bottlenecks,” said Singh. “Facilitating power trade among the three countries and developing transmission infrastructure for the purpose will be the key agenda to be addressed by the trilateral mechanism, as per the Bangladeshi proposal.”

            <p id="two">One morning, I woke up suddenly, drenched in sweat, struggling to catch my breath. It felt oddly familiar, like a scene from my favourite series, ‘Friends’. In the show, a character responds to the common question, “How are you feeling?” with a very uncommon reply: “I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth, and tied it around my neck.” However, my experience didn’t stop there. I also had a racing heart and a sharp pain in my chest. It felt like I was choking, unable to breathe. Despite a parched mouth, I couldn't get up for water because my whole body trembled, leaving me unable to move.

                As I lay there, scared and helpless, I gradually realised what was happening. It was a common mental health condition, something I had studied and assisted clients with before. However, no amount of theory or clinical practice had prepared me for the actual, gut-wrenching experience of a panic attack. But enough about me. Today, I’m not here to share my story but to offer you a glimpse into what millions around the world go through with panic attacks. I also want to share a few things that have been helpful in my personal and professional journey dealing with these symptoms, in the hope that it may assist you or your loved ones facing something similar.
                
                Let’s start by understanding what panic attacks are: they’re intense anxiety reactions where a person may feel overwhelmed by emotions like helplessness and fear. It’s a sudden surge of intense fear or discomfort that peaks within minutes, causing various psychological and physical symptoms.

          <h3>What sleep does to the mind ?</h3>

            Sleep isn’t just a bodily healing process; it’s a crucial element in establishing a foundation for a healthy lifestyle. Beyond renewing the body, sleep significantly influences our overall well-being. A well-rested mind is more resilient and adaptable, better equipped to bounce back from setbacks and handle stress.

Recognising sleep as a dynamic force impacting both our physical and mental well-being underscores its importance in laying a solid foundation for a healthy life. Psychologist Anjana Das Pariyar, a counsellor at Adhyayan School, Tokha in Kathmandu, sheds light on this topic.

Pariyar holds a master’s degree in psychology from the Central Department of Psychology, Tribhuvan University and a postgraduate diploma in school counselling from the same university.

  <h2> What role does sleep play in managing stress and anxiety?</h2>
  <p id="two">
    Adequate sleep is like a reset button for the mind and body, especially when it comes to managing stress and anxiety. When you’re well-rested, your brain can better process and consolidate emotional experiences. This helps in putting things in perspective and preventing the accumulation of stress.

Moreover, when you’re tired, your ability to handle challenges and uncertainties is compromised. You might find yourself more reactive and less able to think clearly. This can escalate stress and contribute to feelings of anxiety.

On the flip side, establishing good sleep habits, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a comfortable sleep environment, and practising relaxation techniques before bedtime, can significantly contribute to stress reduction.
